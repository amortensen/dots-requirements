(DDoS) Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) protocols enabling coordinated response to
DDoS attacks.</t>

<section anchor="problems" title="Introduction">

<section anchor="context-and-motivation" title="Context and Motivation">
<t>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks afflict networks of all kinds,
plaguing network operators at service providers and enterprises around the
world. High-volume attacks saturating inbound links are now common, as attack
scale and frequency continue to increase.</t>

<t>The prevalence and impact of these DDoS attacks has led to an increased focus on
coordinated attack response. However, many enterprises lack the resources or
expertise to operate on-premises attack mitigation solutions themselves, or are
constrained by local bandwidth limitations. To address such gaps, service
providers have begun to offer on-demand traffic scrubbing services, which are
designed to separate the DDoS attack traffic from legitimate traffic and forward
only the latter.</t>

<t>Today, these services offer proprietary interfaces for subscribers to request
attack mitigation. Such proprietary interfaces tie a subscriber to a service
while also limiting the network elements capable of participating in the attack
mitigation. As a result of signaling interface incompatibility, attack responses
may be fragmented or otherwise incomplete, leaving operators in the attack path
unable to assist in the defense.</t>

<t>A standardized method to coordinate a real-time response among involved
operators will increase the speed and effectiveness of DDoS attack mitigation,
and reduce the impact of these attacks. This document describes the required
characteristics of protocols that enable attack response coordination and
mitigation of DDoS attacks.</t>

<t>DDoS Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) communicates the need for defensive action in
anticipation of or in response to an attack, but does not dictate the
implementation of these actions.  The requirements in this document are derived
from <xref target="I-D.ietf-dots-use-cases"></xref> and <xref target="I-D.ietf-dots-architecture"></xref>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">

<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in BCP14 <xref target="RFC2119"/> <xref target="RFC8174"/>,
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals.</t>

<t>This document adopts the following terms:</t>

<t><list style="hanging">
  <t hangText='DDoS:'>
  A distributed denial-of-service attack, in which traffic originating from
multiple sources is directed at a target on a network. DDoS attacks are
intended to cause a negative impact on the availability and/or other
functionality of an attack target. Denial-of-service considerations are
discussed in detail in <xref target="RFC4732"></xref>.</t>
  <t hangText='DDoS attack target:'>
  A network connected entity with a finite set of resources, such as network
bandwidth, memory or CPU, that is the target of a DDoS attack. Potential
targets include (but are not limited to) network elements, network links,
servers, and services.</t>
  <t hangText='DDoS attack telemetry:'>
  Collected measurements and behavioral characteristics defining the nature of a
DDoS attack.</t>
  <t hangText='Countermeasure:'>
  An action or set of actions focused on recognizing and filtering out specific
types of DDoS attack traffic while passing legitimate traffic to the attack
target. Distinct countermeasures can be layered to defend against attacks
combining multiple DDoS attack types.</t>
  <t hangText='Mitigation:'>
  A set of countermeasures enforced against traffic destined for the target or
targets of a detected or reported DDoS attack, where countermeasure
enforcement is managed by an entity in the network path between attack sources
and the attack target. Mitigation methodology is out of scope for this
document.</t>
  <t hangText='Mitigator:'>
  An entity, typically a network element, capable of performing mitigation of a
detected or reported DDoS attack. The means by which this entity performs
these mitigations and how they are requested of it are out of scope for this
document. The mitigator and DOTS server receiving a mitigation request are
assumed to belong to the same administrative entity.</t>
  <t hangText='DOTS client:'>
  A DOTS-aware software module responsible for requesting attack response
coordination with other DOTS-aware elements.</t>
  <t hangText='DOTS server:'>
  A DOTS-aware software module handling and responding to messages from DOTS
clients. The DOTS server enables mitigation on behalf of the DOTS
client, if requested, by communicating the DOTS client's request to the
mitigator and returning selected mitigator feedback to the requesting DOTS
client.</t>
  <t hangText='DOTS agent:'>
  Any DOTS-aware software module capable of participating in a DOTS signal
or data channel. It can be a DOTS client, DOTS server, or, as a logical agent,
a DOTS gateway.</t>
  <t hangText='DOTS gateway:'>
  A DOTS-aware software module resulting from the logical concatenation of the
functionality of a DOTS server and a DOTS client into a single DOTS agent.
This functionality is analogous to a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
<xref target="RFC3261"></xref> Back-to-Back User Agent (B2BUA) <xref target="RFC7092"></xref>. A DOTS gateway has a
client-facing side, which behaves as a DOTS server for downstream clients, and
a server-facing side, which performs the role of DOTS client for upstream DOTS
servers. Client-domain DOTS gateways are DOTS gateways that are in the DOTS
client's domain, while server-domain DOTS gateways denote DOTS gateways that
are in the DOTS server's domain. DOTS gateways are described further in
<xref target="I-D.ietf-dots-architecture"></xref>.</t>
  <t hangText='Signal channel:'>
  A bidirectional, mutually authenticated communication channel between DOTS
agents that is resilient even in conditions leading to severe packet loss,
such as a volumetric DDoS attack causing network congestion.</t>
  <t hangText='DOTS signal:'>
  A concise status/control message transmitted over the authenticated signal
channel between DOTS agents, used to indicate the client's need for
mitigation, or to convey the status of any requested mitigation.</t>
  <t hangText='Heartbeat:'>
  A message transmitted between DOTS agents over the signal channel, used as a
keep-alive and to measure peer health.</t>
  <t hangText='Data channel:'>
  A bidirectional, mutually authenticated communication channel between two
DOTS agents used for infrequent but reliable bulk exchange of data not easily
or appropriately communicated through the signal channel. Reliable bulk data
exchange may not function well or at all during attacks causing network
congestion. The data channel is not expected to operate in such conditions.</t>
  <t hangText='Filter:'>
  A specification of a matching network traffic flow or set of flows. The filter
will typically have a policy associated with it, e.g., rate-limiting or
discarding matching traffic <xref target="RFC4949"></xref>.</t>
  <t hangText='Drop-list:'>
  A list of filters indicating sources from which traffic should be blocked,
regardless of traffic content.</t>
  <t hangText='Accept-list:'>
  A list of filters indicating sources from which traffic should always be
allowed, regardless of contradictory data gleaned in a detected attack.</t>
  <t hangText='Multi-homed DOTS client:'>
  A DOTS client exchanging messages with multiple DOTS servers, each in a
separate administrative domain.</t>
</list></t>

<section anchor="requirements" title="Requirements">

<t>This section describes the required features and characteristics of the DOTS
protocols.</t>

<t>The DOTS protocols enable and manage mitigation on behalf of a network domain or
resource which is or may become the focus of a DDoS attack. An active DDoS
attack against the entity controlling the DOTS client need not be present before
establishing a communication channel between DOTS agents. Indeed, establishing a
relationship with peer DOTS agents during normal network conditions provides the
foundation for more rapid attack response against future attacks, as all
interactions setting up DOTS, including any business or service level
agreements, are already complete. Reachability information of peer DOTS agents
is provisioned to a DOTS client using a variety of manual or dynamic methods.
Once a relationship between DOTS agents is established, regular communication
between DOTS clients and servers enables a common understanding of the DOTS
agents' health and activity.</t>

<t>The DOTS protocol must at a minimum make it possible for a DOTS client to
request aid mounting a defense against a suspected attack. This defense could be
coordinated by a DOTS server and include signaling within or between domains as
requested by local operators. DOTS clients should similarly be able to withdraw
aid requests.  DOTS requires no justification from DOTS clients for requests for
help, nor do DOTS clients need to justify withdrawing help requests: the
decision is local to the DOTS clients' domain. Multi-homed DOTS clients must be
able to select the appropriate DOTS server(s) to which a mitigation request is
to be sent. The method for selecting the appropriate DOTS server in a
multi-homed environment is out of scope for this document.</t>

<t>DOTS protocol implementations face competing operational goals when maintaining
this bidirectional communication stream.  On the one hand, DOTS must include
measures to ensure message confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and replay
protection to keep the protocols from becoming additional vectors for the very
attacks it is meant to help fight off. On the other hand, the protocol must be
resilient under extremely hostile network conditions, providing continued
contact between DOTS agents even as attack traffic saturates the link. Such
resiliency may be developed several ways, but characteristics such as small
message size, asynchronous, redundant message delivery and minimal connection
overhead (when possible given local network policy) will tend to contribute to
the robustness demanded by a viable DOTS protocol. Operators of peer
DOTS-enabled domains may enable quality- or class-of-service traffic tagging to
increase the probability of successful DOTS signal delivery, but DOTS does not
require such policies be in place, and should be viable in their absence.</t>

<t>The DOTS server and client must also have some standardized method of defining
the scope of any mitigation, as well as managing other mitigation-related
configuration.</t>

<t>Finally, DOTS should be sufficiently extensible to meet future needs in
coordinated attack defense, although this consideration is necessarily
superseded by the other operational requirements.</t>

<section anchor="general-requirements" title="General Requirements">

<t><list style="hanging">
  <t hangText='GEN-001'>
  Extensibility: Protocols and data models developed as part of DOTS MUST be
extensible in order to keep DOTS adaptable to operational and proprietary
DDoS defenses. Future extensions MUST be backward compatible. Implementations
of older protocol versions SHOULD ignore information added to DOTS messages as
part of newer protocol versions.</t>
  <t hangText='GEN-002'>
  Resilience and Robustness: The signaling protocol MUST be designed to maximize
the probability of signal delivery even under the severely constrained network
conditions caused by attack traffic. The protocol MUST be resilient, that is,
continue operating despite message loss and out-of-order or redundant message
delivery. In support of signaling protocol robustness, DOTS signals SHOULD be
conveyed over a transport not susceptible to Head of Line Blocking.</t>
  <t hangText='GEN-003'>
  Bulk Data Exchange: Infrequent bulk data exchange between DOTS agents can also
significantly augment attack response coordination, permitting such tasks as
population of drop- or accept-listed source addresses; address or prefix group
aliasing; exchange of incident reports; and other hinting or configuration
supplementing attack response.</t>
  <t>As the resilience requirements for the DOTS signal channel mandate small
signal message size, a separate, secure data channel utilizing a reliable
transport protocol MUST be used for bulk data exchange. However, reliable bulk
data exchange may not be possible during attacks causing network congestion.</t>
  <t hangText='GEN-004'>
  Mitigation Hinting: DOTS clients may have access to attack details which can
be used to inform mitigation techniques. Example attack details might include
locally collected fingerprints for an on-going attack, or anticipated or
active attack focal points based on other threat intelligence. DOTS clients
MAY send mitigation hints derived from attack details to DOTS servers, in the
full understanding that the DOTS server MAY ignore mitigation hints.
Mitigation hints MUST be transmitted across the signal channel, as the data
channel may not be functional during an attack. DOTS server handling of
mitigation hints is implementation-specific.</t>
  <t hangText='GEN-005'>
  Loop Handling: In certain scenarios, typically involving misconfiguration of
DNS or routing policy, it may be possible for communication between DOTS
agents to loop. Signal and data channel implementations should be prepared to
detect and terminate such loops to prevent service disruption.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="signal-channel-requirements" title="Signal Channel Requirements">

<t><list style="hanging">
  <t hangText='SIG-001'>
  Use of Common Transport Protocols: DOTS MUST operate over common widely
deployed and standardized transport protocols. While connectionless transport
such as the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) <xref target="RFC0768"/> SHOULD be used for the
signal channel, the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) <xref target="RFC0793"></xref> MAY be used
if necessary due to network policy or middlebox capabilities or
configurations.</t>
  <t hangText='SIG-002'>
  Sub-MTU Message Size: To avoid message fragmentation and the consequently
decreased probability of message delivery over a congested link, signaling
protocol message size MUST be kept under signaling Path Maximum Transmission
Unit (PMTU), including the byte overhead of any encapsulation, transport
headers, and transport- or message-level security.</t>
  <t>DOTS agents SHOULD attempt to learn the PMTU through mechanisms such as Path
MTU Discovery <xref target="RFC1191"></xref> or Packetization Layer Path MTU Discovery <xref target="RFC4821"></xref>.
If the PMTU cannot be discovered, DOTS agents SHOULD assume a PMTU of 1280
bytes.  If IPv4 support on legacy or otherwise unusual networks is a
consideration and the PMTU is unknown, DOTS implementations MAY rely on a PMTU
of 576 bytes, as discussed in <xref target="RFC0791"></xref> and <xref target="RFC1122"></xref>.</t>
  <t hangText='SIG-003'>
  Bidirectionality: To support peer health detection, to maintain an active
signal channel, and to increase the probability of signal delivery during an
attack, the signal channel MUST be bidirectional, with client and server
transmitting signals to each other at regular intervals, regardless of any
client request for mitigation. The bidirectional signal channel MUST support
unidirectional messaging to enable notifications between DOTS agents.</t>
  <t hangText='SIG-004'>
  Channel Health Monitoring: DOTS agents MUST support exchange of heartbeat
messages over the signal channel to monitor channel health. Peer DOTS agents
SHOULD regularly send heartbeats to each other while a mitigation request is
active. The heartbeat interval during active mitigation could be negotiable,
but SHOULD be frequent enough to maintain any on-path NAT or Firewall bindings
during mitigation.</t>
  <t>To support scenarios in which loss of heartbeat is used to trigger
mitigation, and to keep the channel active, DOTS clients MAY solicit heartbeat
exchanges after successful mutual authentication. When DOTS agents are
exchanging heartbeats and no mitigation request is active, either agent MAY
request changes to the heartbeat rate. For example, a DOTS server might want
to reduce heartbeat frequency or cease heartbeat exchanges when an active DOTS
client has not requested mitigation, in order to control load.</t>
  <t>Following mutual authentication, a signal channel MUST be considered active
until a DOTS agent explicitly ends the session, or either DOTS agent fails to
receive heartbeats from the other after a mutually agreed upon retransmission
procedure has been exhausted. Because heartbeat loss is much more likely
during volumetric attack, DOTS agents SHOULD avoid signal channel termination
when mitigation is active and heartbeats are not received by either DOTS agent
for an extended period. In such circumstances, DOTS clients MAY attempt to
reestablish the signal channel, but SHOULD continue to send heartbeats so that
the DOTS server knows the session is still alive. DOTS servers are assumed to
have the ability to monitor the attack, using feedback from the mitigator and
other available sources, and MAY use the absence of attack traffic and lack of
client heartbeats as an indication the signal channel is defunct.</t>
  <t hangText='SIG-005'>
  Channel Redirection: In order to increase DOTS operational flexibility and
scalability, DOTS servers SHOULD be able to redirect DOTS clients to another
DOTS server at any time. DOTS clients MUST NOT assume the redirection target
DOTS server shares security state with the redirecting DOTS server. DOTS
clients are free to attempt abbreviated security negotiation methods supported
by the protocol, such as DTLS session resumption, but MUST be prepared to
negotiate new security state with the redirection target DOTS server. The
authentication domain of the redirection target DOTS server MUST be the same
as the authentication domain of the redirecting DOTS server.</t>
  <t>Due to the increased likelihood of packet loss caused by link congestion
during an attack, DOTS servers SHOULD NOT redirect while mitigation is enabled
during an active attack against a target in the DOTS client's domain.</t>
  <t hangText='SIG-006'>
  Mitigation Requests and Status:
Authorized DOTS clients MUST be able to request scoped mitigation from DOTS
servers. DOTS servers MUST send status to the DOTS clients about mitigation
requests. If a DOTS server rejects an authorized request for mitigation, the
DOTS server MUST include a reason for the rejection in the status message sent
to the client.</t>
  <t>Due to the higher likelihood of packet loss during a DDoS attack, DOTS
servers SHOULD regularly send mitigation status to authorized DOTS clients
which have requested and been granted mitigation, regardless of client
requests for mitigation status.</t>
  <t>When DOTS client-requested mitigation is active, DOTS server status messages
SHOULD include the following mitigation metrics:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>Total number of packets blocked by the mitigation</t>
        <t>Current number of packets per second blocked</t>
        <t>Total number of bytes blocked</t>
        <t>Current number of bytes per second blocked</t>
      </list>
  </t>
  <t>DOTS clients MAY take these metrics into account when determining whether
to ask the DOTS server to cease mitigation.</t>
  <t>A DOTS client MAY withdraw a mitigation request at any time, regardless of
whether mitigation is currently active. The DOTS server MUST immediately
acknowledge a DOTS client's request to stop mitigation.</t>
  <t>To protect against route or DNS flapping caused by a client rapidly toggling
mitigation, and to dampen the effect of oscillating attacks, DOTS servers MAY
allow mitigation to continue for a limited period after acknowledging a DOTS
client's withdrawal of a mitigation request. During this period, DOTS server
status messages SHOULD indicate that mitigation is active but terminating.
DOTS clients MAY reverse the mitigation termination during this
active-but-terminating  period with a new mitigation request for the same
scope. The DOTS server MUST treat this request as a mitigation lifetime
extension (see SIG-007 below).</t>
  <t>The initial active-but-terminating period is implementation- and deployment-
specific, but SHOULD be sufficiently long to absorb latency incurred by route
propagation. If a DOTS client refreshes the mitigation before the
active-but-terminating period elapses, the DOTS server MAY increase the
active-but-terminating period up to a maximum of 300 seconds (5 minutes).
After the active-but-terminating period elapses, the DOTS server MUST treat
the mitigation as terminated, as the DOTS client is no longer responsible for
the mitigation.</t>
  <t hangText='SIG-007'>
  Mitigation Lifetime: DOTS servers MUST support mitigations for a negotiated
time interval, and MUST terminate a mitigation when the lifetime elapses.
DOTS servers also MUST support renewal of mitigation lifetimes in mitigation
requests from DOTS clients, allowing clients to extend mitigation as necessary
for the duration of an attack.</t>
  <t>DOTS servers MUST treat a mitigation terminated due to lifetime expiration
exactly as if the DOTS client originating the mitigation had asked to end the
mitigation, including the active-but-terminating period, as described above
in SIG-005.</t>
  <t>DOTS clients MUST include a mitigation lifetime in all mitigation requests.</t>
  <t>DOTS servers SHOULD support indefinite mitigation lifetimes, enabling
architectures in which the mitigator is always in the traffic path to the
resources for which the DOTS client is requesting protection. DOTS clients
MUST be prepared to not be granted mitigations with indefinite lifetimes. DOTS
servers MAY refuse mitigations with indefinite lifetimes, for policy reasons.
The reasons themselves are out of scope. If the DOTS server does not grant a
mitigation request with an indefinite mitigation lifetime, it MUST set the
lifetime to a value that is configured locally. That value MUST be returned in
a reply to the requesting DOTS client.</t>
  <t hangText='SIG-008'>
  Mitigation Scope: DOTS clients MUST indicate desired mitigation scope. The
scope type will vary depending on the resources requiring mitigation. All DOTS
agent implementations MUST support the following required scope types:

      <list style="symbols">
        <t>IPv4 prefixes <xref target="RFC4632"></xref></t>
        <t>IPv6 prefixes <xref target="RFC4291"></xref><xref target="RFC5952"/></t>
        <t>Domain names <xref target="RFC1035"></xref></t>
      </list>
  </t>
  <t>The following mitigation scope types are OPTIONAL:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>Uniform Resource Identifiers <xref target="RFC3986"></xref></t>
      </list>
  </t>
  <t>DOTS servers MUST be able to resolve domain names and (when supported) URIs.
How name resolution is managed on the DOTS server is implementation-specific.</t>
  <t>DOTS agents MUST support mitigation scope aliases, allowing DOTS clients and
servers to refer to collections of protected resources by an opaque identifier
created through the data channel, direct configuration, or other means. Domain
name and URI mitigation scopes may be thought of as a form of scope alias, in
which the addresses to which the domain name or URI resolve represent the full
scope of the mitigation.</t>
  <t>If there is additional information available narrowing the scope of any
requested attack response, such as targeted port range, protocol, or service,
DOTS clients SHOULD include that information in client mitigation requests.
DOTS clients MAY also include additional attack details. DOTS servers MAY
ignore such supplemental information when enabling countermeasures on the
mitigator.</t>
  <t>As an active attack evolves, DOTS clients MUST be able to adjust as necessary
the scope of requested mitigation by refining the scope of resources requiring
mitigation.</t>
  <t>A DOTS client may obtain the mitigation scope through direct provisioning
or through implementation-specific methods of discovery. DOTS clients MUST
support at least one mechanism to obtain mitigation scope.</t>
  <t hangText='SIG-009'>
  Mitigation Efficacy: When a mitigation request is active, DOTS clients SHOULD
transmit a metric of perceived mitigation efficacy to the DOTS server. DOTS
servers MAY use the efficacy metric to adjust countermeasures activated on a
mitigator on behalf of a DOTS client.</t>
  <t hangText='SIG-010'>
  Conflict Detection and Notification: Multiple DOTS clients controlled by a
single administrative entity may send conflicting mitigation requests as a
result of misconfiguration, operator error, or compromised DOTS clients. DOTS
servers in the same administrative domain attempting to honor conflicting
requests may flap network route or DNS information, degrading the networks
attempting to participate in attack response with the DOTS clients. DOTS
servers in a single administrative domain SHALL detect such conflicting
requests, and SHALL notify the DOTS clients in conflict. The notification
SHOULD indicate the nature and scope of the conflict, for example, the
overlapping prefix range in a conflicting mitigation request.</t>
  <t hangText='SIG-011'>
  Network Address Translator Traversal: DOTS clients may be deployed behind a
Network Address Translator (NAT), and need to communicate with DOTS servers
through the NAT. DOTS protocols MUST therefore be capable of traversing NATs.</t>
  <t>If UDP is used as the transport for the DOTS signal channel, all
considerations in "Middlebox Traversal Guidelines" in <xref target="RFC8085"></xref> apply to DOTS.
Regardless of transport, DOTS protocols MUST follow established best common
practices established in BCP 127 for NAT traversal
<xref target="RFC4787"></xref><xref target="RFC6888"/><xref target="RFC7857"></xref>.</t>

<t>The data channel is intended to be used for bulk data exchanges between DOTS
agents. Unlike the signal channel, the data channel is not expected to be
constructed to deal with attack conditions.  As the primary function of the data
channel is data exchange, a reliable transport is required in order for DOTS
agents to detect data delivery success or failure.</t>

<t>The data channel provides a protocol for DOTS configuration, management. For
example, a DOTS client may submit to a DOTS server a collection of prefixes it
wants to refer to by alias when requesting mitigation, to which the server would
respond with a success status and the new prefix group alias, or an error status
and message in the event the DOTS client's data channel request failed.</t>

<t><list style="hanging">
  <t hangText='DATA-001'>
  Reliable transport: Messages sent over the data channel MUST be delivered
reliably, in order sent.</t>
  <t hangText='DATA-002'>
  Data privacy and integrity: Transmissions over the data channel are likely to
contain operationally or privacy-sensitive information or instructions from
the remote DOTS agent. Theft, modification, or replay of data channel
transmissions could lead to information leaks or malicious transactions on
behalf of the sending agent (see <xref target="security-considerations"/> below).
Consequently data sent over the data channel MUST be encrypted and
authenticated using current IETF best practices. DOTS servers MUST enable
means to prevent leaking operationally or privacy-sensitive data. Although
administrative entities participating in DOTS may detail what data may be
revealed to third-party DOTS agents, such considerations are not in scope for
this document.</t>
  <t hangText='DATA-003'>
  Resource Configuration: To help meet the general and signal channel
requirements in <xref target="general-requirements"/> and <xref target="signal-channel-requirements"/>,
DOTS server implementations MUST provide an interface to configure resource
identifiers, as described in SIG-008.

DOTS server implementations MAY expose additional configurability. Additional
configurability is implementation-specific.</t>
  <t hangText='DATA-004'>
  Policy management: DOTS servers MUST provide methods for DOTS clients to
manage drop- and accept-lists of traffic destined for resources belonging to
a client.</t>
  <t>For example, a DOTS client should be able to create a drop- or accept-list
entry, retrieve a list of current entries from either list, update the content
of either list, and delete entries as necessary.</t>
  <t>How a DOTS server authorizes DOTS client management of drop- and accept-list
entries is implementation-specific.</t>

<section anchor="security-requirements" title="Security Requirements">

<t>DOTS must operate within a particularly strict security context, as an
insufficiently protected signal or data channel may be subject to abuse,
enabling or supplementing the very attacks DOTS purports to mitigate.</t>

<t><list style="hanging">
  <t hangText='SEC-001'>
  Peer Mutual Authentication: DOTS agents MUST authenticate each other before a
DOTS signal or data channel is considered valid. The method of authentication
is not specified in this document, but should follow current industry best
practices with respect to any cryptographic mechanisms to authenticate the
remote peer.</t>
  <t hangText='SEC-002'>
  Message Confidentiality, Integrity and Authenticity: DOTS protocols MUST take
steps to protect the confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of messages
sent between client and server. While specific transport- and message-level
security options are not specified, the protocols MUST follow current industry
best practices for encryption and message authentication.</t>
  <t>In order for DOTS protocols to remain secure despite advancements in
cryptanalysis and traffic analysis, DOTS agents MUST support secure
negotiatation of the terms and mechanisms of protocol security, subject to
the interoperability and signal message size requirements in
<xref target="signal-channel-requirements"/>.</t>
  <t>While the interfaces between downstream DOTS server and upstream DOTS client
within a DOTS gateway are implementation-specific, those interfaces
nevertheless MUST provide security equivalent to that of the signal channels
bridged by gateways in the signaling path. For example, when a DOTS gateway
consisting of a DOTS server and DOTS client is running on the same logical
device, the two DOTS agents could be implemented within the same process
security boundary.</t>
  <t hangText='SEC-003'>
  Message Replay Protection: To prevent a passive attacker from capturing and
replaying old messages, and thereby potentially disrupting or influencing the
network policy of the receiving DOTS agent's domain, DOTS protocols MUST
provide a method for replay detection and prevention.</t>
  <t>Within the signal channel, messages MUST be uniquely identified such that
replayed or duplicated messages can be detected and discarded. Unique
mitigation requests MUST be processed at most once.</t>
  <t hangText='SEC-004'>
  Authorization: DOTS servers MUST authorize all messages from DOTS clients
which pertain to mitigation, configuration, filtering, or status.</t>
  <t>DOTS servers MUST reject mitigation requests with scopes which the DOTS client
is not authorized to manage.</t>
  <t>Likewise, DOTS servers MUST refuse to allow creation, modification or deletion
of scope aliases and drop-/accept-lists when the DOTS client is unauthorized.</t>
  <t>The modes of authorization are implementation-specific.</t>

<section anchor="data-model-requirements" title="Data Model Requirements">

<t>A well-structured DOTS data model is critical to the development of successful
DOTS protocols.</t>

<t><list style="hanging">
  <t hangText='DM-001'>
  Structure: The data model structure for the DOTS protocol MAY be described by
a single module, or be divided into related collections of hierarchical
modules and sub-modules. If the data model structure is split across modules,
those distinct modules MUST allow references to describe the overall data
model's structural dependencies.</t>
  <t hangText='DM-002'>
  Versioning: To ensure interoperability between DOTS protocol implementations,
data models MUST be versioned. How the protocols represent data model versions
is not defined in this document.</t>
  <t hangText='DM-003'>
  Mitigation Status Representation: The data model MUST provide the ability to
represent a request for mitigation and the withdrawal of such a request. The
data model MUST also support a representation of currently requested
mitigation status, including failures and their causes.</t>
  <t hangText='DM-004'>
  Mitigation Scope Representation: The data model MUST support representation of
a requested mitigation's scope. As mitigation scope may be represented in
several different ways, per SIG-007 above, the data model MUST include
extensible representation of mitigation scope.</t>
  <t hangText='DM-005'>
  Mitigation Lifetime Representation: The data model MUST support representation
of a mitigation request's lifetime, including mitigations with no specified
end time.</t>
  <t hangText='DM-006'>
  Mitigation Efficacy Representation: The data model MUST support representation
of a DOTS client's understanding of the efficacy of a mitigation enabled
through a mitigation request.</t>
  <t hangText='DM-007'>
  Acceptable Signal Loss Representation: The data model MUST be able to
represent the DOTS agent's preference for acceptable signal loss when
establishing a signal channel, as described in GEN-002. Measurements of loss
might include, but are not restricted to, number of consecutive missed
heartbeat messages, retransmission count, or request timeouts.</t>
  <t hangText='DM-008'>
  Heartbeat Interval Representation: The data model MUST be able to represent
the DOTS agent's preferred heartbeat interval, which the client may include
when establishing the signal channel, as described in SIG-003.</t>
  <t hangText='DM-009'>
  Relationship to Transport: The DOTS data model MUST NOT depend on the
specifics of any transport to represent fields in the model.</t>

<section anchor="signal-channel" title="Signal Channel">

<t>As part of a protocol expected to operate over links affected by DDoS attack
traffic, the DOTS signal channel MUST NOT contribute significantly to link
congestion. To meet the signal channel requirements above, DOTS signal channel
implementations SHOULD support connectionless transports. However, some
connectionless transports when deployed naively can be a source of network
congestion, as discussed in <xref target="RFC8085"></xref>. Signal channel implementations using such
connectionless transports, such as UDP, therefore MUST include a congestion
control mechanism.</t>

<t>Signal channel implementations using TCP may rely on built-in TCP congestion
control support.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="data-channel" title="Data Channel">
<t>As specified in DATA-001, the data channel requires reliable, in-order message
delivery. Data channel implementations using TCP may rely on the TCP
implementation's built-in congestion control mechanisms.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="security-considerations" title="Security Considerations">

<t>This document informs future protocols under development, and so does not have
security considerations of its own. However, operators should be aware of
potential risks involved in deploying DOTS. DOTS agent impersonation and signal
blocking are discussed here. Additional DOTS security considerations may be
found in <xref target="I-D.ietf-dots-architecture"></xref> and DOTS protocol documents.</t>

<t>Impersonation of either a DOTS server or a DOTS client could have catastrophic
impact on operations in either domain. If an attacker has the ability to
impersonate a DOTS client, that attacker can affect policy on the network path
to the DOTS client's domain, up to and including instantiation of drop-lists
blocking all inbound traffic to networks for which the DOTS client is authorized
to request mitigation.</t>

<t>Similarly, an impersonated DOTS server may be able to act as a sort of malicious
DOTS gateway, intercepting requests from the downstream DOTS client, and
modifying them before transmission to the DOTS server to inflict the desired
impact on traffic to or from the DOTS client's domain. Among other things, this
malicious DOTS gateway might receive and discard mitigation requests from the
DOTS client, ensuring no requested mitigation is ever applied.</t>

<t>As detailed in <xref target="security-requirements"/>, DOTS implementations require mutual
authentication of DOTS agents in order to make agent impersonation more
difficult. However, impersonation may still be possible as a result of
credential theft, implementation flaws, or compromise of DOTS agents. To detect
misuse, DOTS operators should carefully monitor and audit DOTS agents, while
employing current secure network communications best practices to reduce attack
surface.</t>

<t>Blocking communication between DOTS agents has the potential to disrupt the core
function of DOTS, which is to request mitigation of active or expected DDoS
attacks. The DOTS signal channel is expected to operate over congested inbound
links, and, as described in <xref target="signal-channel-requirements"/>, the signal channel
protocol must be designed for minimal data transfer to reduce the incidence of
signal loss.</t>
