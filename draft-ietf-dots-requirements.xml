(DDoS) Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) protocols enabling coordinated response to
DDoS attacks.</t>

<section anchor="problems" title="Introduction">

<section anchor="context-and-motivation" title="Context and Motivation">
<t>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks afflict networks of all kinds,
plaguing network operators at service providers and enterprises around the
world. High-volume attacks saturating inbound links are now common, as attack
scale and frequency continue to increase.</t>

<t>The prevalence and impact of these DDoS attacks has led to an increased focus on
coordinated attack response. However, many enterprises lack the resources or
expertise to operate on-premises attack mitigation solutions themselves, or are
constrained by local bandwidth limitations. To address such gaps, service
providers have begun to offer on-demand traffic scrubbing services, which are
designed to separate the DDoS attack traffic from legitimate traffic and forward
only the latter.</t>

<t>Today, these services offer proprietary interfaces for subscribers to request
attack mitigation. Such proprietary interfaces tie a subscriber to a service
while also limiting the network elements capable of participating in the attack
mitigation. As a result of signaling interface incompatibility, attack responses
may be fragmented or otherwise incomplete, leaving operators in the attack path
unable to assist in the defense.</t>

<t>A standardized method to coordinate a real-time response among involved
operators will increase the speed and effectiveness of DDoS attack mitigation,
and reduce the impact of these attacks. This document describes the required
characteristics of protocols that enable attack coordination and mitigation of
DDoS attacks.</t>

<t>DDoS Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) communicates the need for defensive action in
anticipation of or in response to an attack, but does not dictate the
implementation of these actions.  The requirements in this document are derived
from <xref target="I-D.ietf-dots-use-cases"></xref> and <xref target="I-D.ietf-dots-architecture"></xref>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">

<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>

<t>This document adopts the following terms:</t>

<t><list style="hanging">
  <t hangText='DDoS:'>
  A distributed denial-of-service attack, in which traffic originating from
multiple sources is directed at a target on a network. DDoS attacks are
intended to cause a negative impact on the availability and/or other
functionality of an attack target. Denial-of-service considerations are
discussed in detail in <xref target="RFC4732"></xref>.</t>
  <t hangText='DDoS attack target:'>
  A network connected entity with a finite set of resources, such as network
bandwidth, memory or CPU, that is the target of a DDoS attack. Potential
targets include (but are not limited to) network elements, network links,
servers, and services.</t>
  <t hangText='DDoS attack telemetry:'>
  Collected measurements and behavioral characteristics defining the nature of a
DDoS attack.</t>
  <t hangText='Countermeasure:'>
  An action or set of actions focused on recognizing and filtering out specific
types of DDoS attack traffic while passing legitimate traffic to the attack
target. Distinct countermeasures can be layered to defend against attacks
combining multiple DDoS attack types.</t>
  <t hangText='Mitigation:'>
  A set of countermeasures enforced against traffic destined for the target or
targets of a detected or reported DDoS attack, where countermeasure
enforcement is managed by an entity in the network path between attack sources
and the attack target. Mitigation methodology is out of scope for this
document.</t>
  <t hangText='Mitigator:'>
  An entity, typically a network element, capable of performing mitigation of a
detected or reported DDoS attack. The means by which this entity performs
these mitigations and how they are requested of it are out of scope. The
mitigator and DOTS server receiving a mitigation request are assumed to belong
to the same administrative entity.</t>
  <t hangText='DOTS client:'>
  A DOTS-aware software module responsible for requesting attack response
coordination with other DOTS-aware elements.</t>
  <t hangText='DOTS server:'>
  A DOTS-aware software module handling and responding to messages from DOTS
clients. The DOTS server enables mitigation on behalf of the DOTS
client, if requested, by communicating the DOTS client's request to the
mitigator and returning selected mitigator feedback to the requesting DOTS
client.</t>
  <t hangText='DOTS agent:'>
  Any DOTS-aware software module capable of participating in a DOTS signal
or data channel. It can be a DOTS client, DOTS server, or, as a logical agent,
a DOTS gateway.</t>
  <t hangText='DOTS gateway:'>
  A DOTS-aware software module resulting from the logical concatenation of the
functionality of a DOTS server and a DOTS client into a single DOTS agent.
This functionality is analogous to a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
<xref target="RFC3261"></xref> Back-to-Back User Agent (B2BUA) <xref target="RFC7092"></xref>. A DOTS gateway has a
client-facing side, which behaves as a DOTS server for downstream clients, and
a server-facing side, which performs the role of DOTS client for upstream DOTS
servers. Client-domain DOTS gateways are DOTS gateways that are in the DOTS
client's domain, while server-domain DOTS gateways denote DOTS gateways that
are in the DOTS server's domain. DOTS gateways are described further in
<xref target="I-D.ietf-dots-architecture"></xref>.</t>
  <t hangText='Signal channel:'>
  A bidirectional, mutually authenticated communication channel between DOTS
agents that is resilient even in conditions leading to severe packet loss,
such as a volumetric DDoS attack causing network congestion.</t>
  <t hangText='DOTS signal:'>
  A concise authenticated status/control message transmitted over the signal
channel between DOTS agents, used to indicate the client's need for
mitigation, as well as to convey the status of any requested mitigation.</t>
  <t hangText='Heartbeat:'>
  A message transmitted between DOTS agents over the signal channel, used as a
keep-alive and to measure peer health.</t>
  <t hangText='Data channel:'>
  A bidirectional, mutually authentication communincation channel between two
DOTS agents used for infrequent but reliable bulk exchange of data not easily
or appropriately communicated through the signal channel under attack
conditions.</t>
  <t hangText='Filter:'>
  A specification of a matching network traffic flow or set of flows. The filter
will typically have a policy associated with it, e.g., rate-limiting or
discarding matching traffic <xref target="RFC4949"></xref>.</t>
  <t hangText='Blacklist:'>
  A list of filters indicating sources from which traffic should be blocked,
regardless of traffic content.</t>
  <t hangText='Whitelist:'>
  A list of filters indicating sources from which traffic should always be
allowed, regardless of contradictory data gleaned in a detected attack.</t>
  <t hangText='Multi-homed DOTS client:'>
  A DOTS client exchanging messages with multiple DOTS servers, each in a
separate administrative domain.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="requirements" title="Requirements">

<t>This section describes the required features and characteristics of the DOTS
protocols.</t>

<t>The DOTS protocols enable and manage mitigation on behalf of a network domain or
resource which is or may become the focus of a DDoS attack. An active DDoS
attack against the entity controlling the DOTS client need not be present before
establishing a communication channel between DOTS agents. Indeed, establishing a
relationship with peer DOTS agents during normal network conditions provides the
foundation for more rapid attack response against future attacks, as all
interactions setting up DOTS, including any business or service level
agreements, are already complete. Reachability information of peer DOTS agents
is provisioned to a DOTS client using a variety of manual or dynamic methods.
Once a relationship between DOTS agents is established, regular communication
between DOTS clients and servers enables a common understanding of the DOTS
agents' health and activity.</t>

<t>The DOTS protocol must at a minimum make it possible for a DOTS client to
request aid mounting a defense, coordinated by a DOTS server, against a
suspected attack, signaling within or between domains as requested by local
operators. DOTS clients should similarly be able to withdraw aid requests.  DOTS
requires no justification from DOTS clients for requests for help, nor do DOTS
clients need to justify withdrawing help requests: the decision is local to the
DOTS clients' domain. Multi-homed DOTS clients must be able to select the
appropriate DOTS server(s) to which a mitigation request is to be sent. The
method for selecting the appropriate DOTS server in a multi-homed environment is
out of scope.</t>

<t>DOTS protocol implementations face competing operational goals when maintaining
this bidirectional communication stream.  On the one hand, DOTS must include
protections ensuring message confidentiality, integrity and authenticity to keep
the protocols from becoming additional vectors for the very attadcks it is meant
to help fight off. On the other hand, the protocol must be resilient under
extremely hostile network conditions, providing continued contact between DOTS
agents even as attack traffic saturates the link. Such resiliency may be
developed several ways, but characteristics such as small message size,
asynchronous, redundant message delivery and minimal connection overhead (when
possible given local network policy) will tend to contribute to the robustness
demanded by a viable DOTS protocol. Operators of peer DOTS-enabled domains may
enable quality- or class-of-service traffic tagging to increase the probability
of successful DOTS signal delivery, but DOTS does not require such policies be
in place, and should be viable in their absence.</t>

<t>The DOTS server and client must also have some standardized method of defining
the scope of any mitigation, and negotiating related mitigation communication
and actions and communications.</t>

<t>Finally, DOTS should be sufficiently extensible to meet future needs in
coordinated attack defense, although this consideration is necessarily
superseded by the other operational requirements.</t>

<section anchor="general-requirements" title="General Requirements">

<t><list style="hanging">
  <t hangText='GEN-001'>
  Extensibility: Protocols and data models developed as part of DOTS MUST be
extensible in order to keep DOTS adaptable to operational and proprietary
DDoS defenses. Future extensions MUST be backward compatible. DOTS protocols
MUST use a version number system to distinguish protocol revisions.
Implementations of older protocol versions SHOULD ignore information added
to DOTS messages as part of newer protocol versions.</t>
  <t hangText='GEN-002'>
  Resilience and Robustness: The signaling protocol MUST be designed to maximize
the probability of signal delivery even under the severely constrained network
conditions caused by particular attack traffic. The protocol MUST be
resilient, that is, continue operating despite message loss and out-of-order
or redundant message delivery. In support of signaling protocol robustness,
DOTS signals SHOULD be conveyed over a transport not susceptible to
Head of Line Blocking.</t>
  <t hangText='GEN-003'>
  Bidirectionality: To support peer health detection, to maintain an active
signal channel, and increase the probability of signal delivery during an
attack, the signal channel MUST be bidirectional, with client and server
transmitting signals to each other at regular intervals, regardless of any
client request for mitigation. Unidirectional messages MUST be supported
within the bidirectional signal channel to allow for unsolicited message
delivery, enabling asynchronous notifications between DOTS agents.</t>
  <t hangText='GEN-004'>
  Bulk Data Exchange: Infrequent bulk data exchange between DOTS agents can also
significantly augment attack response coordination, permitting such tasks as
population of black- or white-listed source addresses; address or prefix group
aliasing; exchange of incident reports; and other hinting or configuration
supplementing attack response.</t>
  <t>As the resilience requirements for the DOTS signal channel mandate small
signal message size, a separate, secure data channel utilizing a reliable
transport protocol MUST be used for bulk data exchange.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="signal-channel-requirements" title="Signal Channel Requirements">

<t><list style="hanging">
  <t hangText='SIG-001'>
  Use of Common Transport Protocols: DOTS MUST operate over common widely
deployed and standardized transport protocols. While connectionless transport
such as the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) <xref target="RFC0768"/> SHOULD be used for the
signal channel, the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) <xref target="RFC0793"></xref> MAY be used
if necessary due to network policy or middlebox capabilities or
configurations.</t>
  <t hangText='SIG-002'>
  Sub-MTU Message Size: To avoid message fragmentation and the consequently
decreased probability of message delivery over a congested link, signaling
protocol message size MUST be kept under signaling Path Maximum Transmission
Unit (PMTU), including the byte overhead of any encapsulation, transport
headers, and transport- or message-level security.</t>
  <t>DOTS agents SHOULD attempt to learn the PMTU through mechanisms such as Path
MTU Discovery <xref target="RFC1191"></xref> or Packetization Layer Path MTU Discovery <xref target="RFC4821"></xref>.
If the PMTU cannot be discovered, DOTS agents SHOULD assume a PMTU of 1280
bytes.  If IPv4 support on legacy or otherwise unusual networks is a
consideration and PMTU is unknown, DOTS implementations MAY rely on a PMTU of
576 bytes, as discussed in <xref target="RFC0791"></xref> and <xref target="RFC1122"></xref>.</t>
  <t hangText='SIG-003'>
  Channel Health Monitoring: DOTS agents MUST support exchange of heartbeat
messages over the signal channel to monitor channel health. Peer DOTS agents
SHOULD regularly send heartbeats to each other while a mitigation request is
active. The heartbeat interval during active mitigation could be negotiable,
but SHOULD be frequent enough to maintain any on-path NAT or Firewall bindings
during mitigation.</t>
  <t>To support scenarios in which loss of heartbeat is used to trigger
mitigation, and to keep the channel active, DOTS clients MAY solicit heartbeat
exchanges after successful mutual authentication. When DOTS agents are
exchanging heartbeats and no mitigation request is active, either agent MAY
request changes to the heartbeat rate. For example, a DOTS server might want
to reduce heartbeat frequency or cease heartbeat exchanges when an active DOTS
client has not requested mitigation, in order to control load.</t>
  <t>Following mutual authentication, a signal channel MUST be considered active
until a DOTS agent explicitly ends the session, or either DOTS agent fails to
receive heartbeats from the other after a mutually agreed upon retransmission
procedure has been exhausted. Because heartbeat loss is much more likely
during volumetric attack, DOTS agents SHOULD avoid signal channel termination
when mitigation is active and heartbeats are not received by either DOTS agent
for an extended period. In such circumstances, DOTS clients MAY attempt to
reestablish the signal channel, but SHOULD continue to send heartbeats so that
the DOTS server knows the session is still alive. DOTS servers are assumed to
have the ability to monitor the attack, using feedback from the mitigator and
other available sources, and MAY use the absence of attack traffic and lack of
client heartbeats as an indication the signal channel is defunct.</t>
  <t hangText='SIG-004'>
  Channel Redirection: In order to increase DOTS operational flexibility and
scalability, DOTS servers SHOULD be able to redirect DOTS clients to another
DOTS server at any time. DOTS clients MUST NOT assume the redirection target
DOTS server shares security state with the redirecting DOTS server. DOTS
clients are free to attempt abbreviated security negotiation methods supported
by the protocol, such as DTLS session resumption, but MUST be prepared to
negotiate new security state with the redirection target DOTS server.</t>
  <t>Due to the increased likelihood of packet loss caused by link congestion
during an attack, DOTS servers SHOULD NOT redirect while mitigation is enabled
during an active attack against a target in the DOTS client's domain.</t>
  <t hangText='SIG-005'>
  Mitigation Requests and Status:
Authorized DOTS clients MUST be able to request scoped mitigation from DOTS
servers. DOTS servers MUST send status to the DOTS clients about mitigation
requests. If a DOTS server rejects an authorized request for mitigation, the
DOTS server MUST include a reason for the rejection in the status message sent
to the client.</t>
  <t>Due to the higher likelihood of packet loss during a DDoS attack, DOTS
servers SHOULD regularly send mitigation status to authorized DOTS clients
which have requested and been granted mitigation, regardless of client
requests for mitigation status.</t>
  <t>When DOTS client-requested mitigation is active, DOTS server status messages
SHOULD include the following mitigation metrics:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>Total number of packets blocked by the mitigation</t>
        <t>Current number of packets per second blocked</t>
        <t>Total number of bytes blocked</t>
        <t>Current number of bytes per second blocked</t>
      </list>
  </t>
  <t>DOTS clients MAY take these metrics into account when determining whether
to ask the DOTS server to cease mitigation.</t>
  <t>A DOTS client MAY withdraw a mitigation request at any time, regardless of
whether mitigation is currently active. The DOTS server MUST immediately
acknowledge a DOTS client's request to stop mitigation.</t>
  <t>To protect against route or DNS flapping caused by a client rapidly toggling
mitigation, and to dampen the effect of oscillating attacks, DOTS servers MAY
allow mitigation to continue for a limited period after acknowledging a DOTS
client's withdrawal of a mitigation request. During this period, DOTS server
status messages SHOULD indicate that mitigation is active but terminating.</t>
  <t>The initial active-but-terminating period is implementation- and deployment-
specific, but SHOULD be sufficiently long to absorb latency incurred by route
propagation. If the client requests mitigation again before the initial
active-but-terminating period elapses, the DOTS server MAY exponentially
increase the active-but-terminating period up to a maximum of 300 seconds (5
minutes). After the active-but-terminating period elapses, the DOTS server
MUST treat the mitigation as terminated, as the DOTS client is no longer
responsible for the mitigation.</t>
  <t hangText='SIG-006'>
  Mitigation Lifetime: DOTS servers MUST support mitigations for a negotiated
time interval or lifetime, and MUST terminate a mitigation when the lifetime
elapses.  DOTS servers also MUST support renewal of mitigation lifetimes in
mitigation requests from DOTS clients, allowing clients to extend mitigation
as necessary for the duration of an attack.</t>
  <t>DOTS servers MUST treat a mitigation terminated due to lifetime expiration
exactly as if the DOTS client originating the mitigation had asked to end the
mitigation, including the active-but-terminating period, as described above
in SIG-005.</t>
  <t>DOTS clients MUST include a mitigation lifetime in all mitigation requests.</t>
  <t>DOTS servers SHOULD support indefinite mitigation lifetimes, enabling
architectures in which the mitigator is always in the traffic path to the
resources for which the DOTS client is requesting protection. DOTS clients
MUST be prepared to not be granted mitigations with indefinite lifetimes. DOTS
servers MAY refuse mitigations with indefinite lifetimes, for policy reasons.
The reasons themselves are out of scope. If the DOTS server does not grant a
mitigation request with an indefinite mitigation lifetime, it MUST set the
lifetime to a value that is configured locally. That value MUST be returned in
a reply to the requesting DOTS client.</t>
  <t hangText='SIG-007'>
  Mitigation Scope: DOTS clients MUST indicate desired mitigation scope. The
scope type will vary depending on the resources requiring mitigation. All DOTS
agent implementations MUST support the following required scope types:

      <list style="symbols">
        <t>IPv4 prefixes in CIDR notation <xref target="RFC4632"></xref></t>
        <t>IPv6 prefixes <xref target="RFC4291"></xref><xref target="RFC5952"/></t>
        <t>Domain names <xref target="RFC1035"></xref></t>
      </list>
  </t>
  <t>The following mitigation scope types are OPTIONAL:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>Uniform Resource Identifiers <xref target="RFC3986"></xref></t>
      </list>
  </t>
  <t>DOTS servers MUST be able to resolve domain names and (when supported) URIs.
How name resolution is managed on the DOTS server is implementation-specific.</t>
  <t>DOTS agents MUST support mitigation scope aliases, allowing DOTS clients and
servers to refer to collections of protected resources by an opaque identifier
created through the data channel, direct configuration, or other means. Domain
name and URI mitigation scopes may be thought of as a form of scope alias, in
which the addresses to which the domain name or URI resolve represent the full
scope of the mitigation.</t>
  <t>If there is additional information available narrowing the scope of any
requested attack response, such as targeted port range, protocol, or service,
DOTS clients SHOULD include that information in client mitigation requests.
DOTS clients MAY also include additional attack details. DOTS servers MAY
ignore such supplemental information when enabling countermeasures on the
mitigator.</t>
  <t>As an active attack evolves, DOTS clients MUST be able to adjust as necessary
the scope of requested mitigation by refining the scope of resources requiring
mitigation.</t>
  <t>A DOTS client may obtain the mitigation scope through direct provisioning
or through implementation-specific methods of discovery. DOTS clients MUST
support at least one mechanism to obtain mitigation scope.</t>
  <t hangText='SIG-008'>
  Mitigation Efficacy: When a mitigation request is active, DOTS clients SHOULD
transmit a metric of perceived mitigation efficacy to the DOTS server. DOTS
servers MAY use the efficacy metric to adjust countermeasures activated on a
mitigator on behalf of a DOTS client.</t>
  <t hangText='SIG-009'>
  Conflict Detection and Notification: Multiple DOTS clients controlled by a
single administrative entity may send conflicting mitigation requests as a
result of misconfiguration, operator error, or compromised DOTS clients. DOTS
servers in the same administrative domain attempting to honor conflicting
requests may flap network route or DNS information, degrading the networks
attempting to participate in attack response with the DOTS clients. DOTS
servers in a single administrative domain SHALL detect such conflicting
requests, and SHALL notify the DOTS clients in conflict. The notification
SHOULD indicate the nature and scope of the conflict, for example, the
overlapping prefix range in a conflicting mitigation request.</t>
  <t hangText='SIG-010:'>
  Network Address Translator Traversal: DOTS clients may be deployed behind a
Network Address Translator (NAT), and need to communicate with DOTS servers
through the NAT. DOTS protocols MUST therefore be capable of traversing NATs.</t>
  <t>If UDP is used as the transport for the DOTS signal channel, all
considerations in "Middlebox Traversal Guidelines" in <xref target="RFC8085"></xref> apply to DOTS.
Regardless of transport, DOTS protocols MUST follow established best common
practices established in BCP 127 for NAT traversal
<xref target="RFC4787"></xref><xref target="RFC6888"/><xref target="RFC7857"></xref>.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="data-channel-requirements" title="Data Channel Requirements">

<t>The data channel is intended to be used for bulk data exchanges between DOTS
agents. Unlike the signal channel, the data channel is not expected to be
constructed to deal with attack conditions.  As the primary function of the data
channel is data exchange, a reliable transport is required in order for DOTS
agents to detect data delivery success or failure.</t>

<t>The data channel provides a protocol for DOTS configuration, management. For
example, a DOTS client may submit to a DOTS server a collection of prefixes it
wants to refer to by alias when requesting mitigation, to which the server would
respond with a success status and the new prefix group alias, or an error status
and message in the event the DOTS client's data channel request failed.</t>

<t><list style="hanging">
  <t hangText='DATA-001'>
  Reliable transport: Messages sent over the data channel MUST be delivered
reliably, in order sent.</t>
  <t hangText='DATA-002'>
  Data privacy and integrity: Transmissions over the data channel are likely to
contain operationally or privacy-sensitive information or instructions from
the remote DOTS agent. Theft or modification of data channel transmissions
could lead to information leaks or malicious transactions on behalf of the
sending agent (see <xref target="security-considerations"/> below). Consequently data sent
over the data channel MUST be encrypted and authenticated using current

  Peer Mutual Authentication: DOTS agents MUST authenticate each other before a

  <t hangText='SEC-002'>
  Message Confidentiality, Integrity and Authenticity: DOTS protocols MUST take
steps to protect the confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of messages

security options are not specified, the protocols MUST follow current industry
best practices for encryption and message authentication.</t>
  <t>In order for DOTS protocols to remain secure despite advancements in
cryptanalysis and traffic analysis, DOTS agents MUST be able to negotiate the
terms and mechanisms of protocol security, subject to the interoperability and
signal message size requirements in <xref target="signal-channel-requirements"/>.</t>
  <t>While the interfaces between downstream DOTS server and upstream DOTS client
within a DOTS gateway are implementation-specific, those interfaces
nevertheless MUST provide security equivalent to that of the signal channels
bridged by gateways in the signaling path. For example, when a DOTS gateway
consisting of a DOTS server and DOTS client is running on the same logical
device, the two DOTS agents could be implemented within the same process
security boundary.</t>

  Message Replay Protection: To prevent a passive attacker from capturing and
replaying old messages, and thereby potentially disrupting or influencing the

those distinct modules MUST allow references to describe the overall data
model's structural dependencies.</t>

<section anchor="signal-channel" title="Signal Channel">

<t>As part of a protocol expected to operate over links affected by DDoS attack
traffic, the DOTS signal channel MUST NOT contribute significantly to link
congestion. To meet the signal channel requirements above, DOTS signal channel
implementations SHOULD support connectionless transports. However, some
connectionless transports when deployed naively can be a source of network
congestion, as discussed in <xref target="RFC5405"></xref>. Signal channel implementations using such
connectionless transports, such as UDP, therefore MUST include a congestion
control mechanism.</t>

<t>Signal channel implementations using TCP may rely on built-in TCP congestion
control support.</t>

<section anchor="data-channel" title="Data Channel">
<t>As specified in DATA-001, the data channel requires reliable, in-order message
delivery. Data channel implementations using TCP may rely on the TCP
implementation's built-in congestion control mechanisms.</t>

<section anchor="security-considerations" title="Security Considerations">

<t>This document informs future protocols under development, and so does not have
its security considerations of its own. However, naive DOTS deployment
potentially exposes networks to new attack vectors. The three primary attack
vectors are DOTS agent impersonation, traffic injection, and signal blocking.</t>

<t>Impersonation of either DOTS server or DOTS client could have catastrophic
impact on operations in either domain. Should an attacker develop the ability to
impersonate a DOTS client, that attacker can affect policy on the network path
to the DOTS client's domain, up to and including instantiation of blacklists
blocking all inbound traffic to networks for which the DOTS client is authorized
to request mitigation. Similarly, an impersonated DOTS server may be able to act
as a sort of malicious DOTS gateway, intercepting requests from the downstream
DOTS client, modifying them to inflict the desired impact on traffic to or from
the DOTS client's domain. Among other things, this malicious DOTS gateway might
receive mitigation requests from the DOTS client, and simply discard them,
ensuring no mitigation is ever applied.</t>

<t>Traffic injection into a naive DOTS deployment could allow an attacker to
affect DOTS operations selectively. Rather than impersonating a DOTS agent
directly, the attacker crafts DOTS signal or data channel messages in such a way
that the targeted DOTS agent treats them as if they originated with a legitimate
DOTS agent, for example, by spoofing the sender's IP address. As with agent
impersonation, the attacker capable of injecting traffic can affect the network
path to addresses for which the DOTS client is authorized to request mitigation.</t>

<t>Blocking communication between DOTS agents&#8211;signal blocking&#8211;has the
potential to disrupt the core function of DOTS, which is to request mitigation
of active or expected DDoS attacks. The DOTS signal channel is expected to
operate over congested inbound links, and, as described in
<xref target="signal-channel-requirements"/>, the signal channel protocol must be designed
for minimal data transfer to reduce the incidence of signal blocking.</t>

<t>As detailed in <xref target="security-requirements"/>, DOTS implementations require mutual
authentication of DOTS agents in order to make agent impersonation and traffic
injection more difficult. However, impersonation or traffic injection may still
be possible as a result of credential theft, implementation flaws, or compromise
of DOTS agents. Operators should take steps to reduce attack surfaces through
current secure network communications best practices.</t>
