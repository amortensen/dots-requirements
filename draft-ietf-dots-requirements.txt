1.  Introduction

1.1.  Overview

   Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks continue to plague
   networks around the globe, from Tier-1 service providers on down to
   enterprises and small businesses.  Attack scale and frequency
   similarly have continued to increase, thanks to software
   vulnerabilities leading to reflection and amplification attacks.
   Once staggering attack traffic volume is now the norm, and the impact
   of larger-scale attacks attract the attention of international press
   agencies.

   The higher profile and greater impact of contemporary DDoS attacks
   has led to increased focus on coordinated attack response.  Many
   institutions and enterprises lack the resources or expertise to
   operate on-premise attack prevention solutions themselves.  To
   address that gap, security service providers have begun to offer on-
   demand traffic scrubbing services.  Each service offers its own
   interface for subscribers to request attack mitigation, tying
   subcribers to proprietary implementations while also limiting the
   subset of network elements capable of participating in the attack
   response.  As a result of incompatibility across services, attack
   response may be fragmentary or otherwise incomplete, leaving key
   players in the attack path unable to assist in the defense.

   There are many ways to respond to an ongoing DDoS attack, some of
   them better than others, but the lack of a common method to
   coordinate a real-time response across layers and network domains
   inhibits the speed and effectiveness of DDoS attack mitigation.

   DOTS was formed to address this lack.  The DOTS protocols are
   therefore not concerned with the form of response, but rather with
   communicating the need for a response, supplementing the call for
   help with pertinent details about the detected attack.  To achieve
   this aim, the protocol must permit the DOTS client to request or
   withdraw a request for coordinated mitigation; to set the scope of
   mitigation, restricted to the client's network space; and to supply
   summarized attack information and additional hints the DOTS server
   elements can use to increase the accuracy and speed of the attack
   response.

   As the DOTS charter makes clear, the protocol must also continue to
   operate even in extreme network conditions.  It must be resilient
   enough to ensure a high probability of signal delivery in spite of
   high packet loss rates.  As such, elements should be in regular,
   bidirectional contact to measure peer health, provide mitigation-
   related feedback, and allow for active mitigation adjustments.

   Lastly, the protocol must take care to ensure the confidentiality,
   integrity and authenticity of messages passed between peers to
   prevent the protocol from being repurposed to contribute to the very
   attacks it's meant to deflect.

   Drawing on the DOTS use cases [I-D.ietf-dots-use-cases] for
   reference, this document details the requirements for protocols
   achieving the DOTS goal of standards-based open threat signaling.

1.2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The following terms are used to define relationships between
   elements, the data they exchange, and methods of communication among
   them:

   attack telemetry:  collected network traffic characteristics defining
      the nature of a DDoS attack.

   mitigation:  A defensive response against a detected and classified
      DDoS attack, performed by an entity in the network path between
      attack sources and the attack target, either through inline

      deployment or some form of traffic diversion.  The form mitigation
      takes is out of scope for this document, but is often deployed in
      such a way that attack traffic is "scrubbed" from the data stream
      while allowing other traffic through.  The term "attack response
      coordination" synonymous in this document.

   mitigator:  A network element or set of network element capable of
      performing mitigation of a detected and classified DDoS attack.

   client:  A DOTS-aware network element requesting attack response
      coordination with another DOTS-aware element, with the expectation
      that the remote endpoint is capable of helping fend off the attack
      against the client.

   server:  A DOTS-aware network element handling and responding to
      messages from a client.  The server may enable mitigation on
      behalf of the client, if requested, by communicating the client's
      request to the mitigator and relaying any mitigator feedback to
      the client.  A server MAY also be a mitigator.

   signal channel:  A bidirectional, mutually authenticated
      communication layer between client and server characterized by
      resilience even in conditions leading to severe packet loss, such
      as a volumetric DDoS attack causing network congestion.

   beacon:  A minimized, authenticated and combined status/control
      message between two DOTS-aware endpoints transmitted over the
      signal channel, crafted to contribute to the resilience of the
      signal channel.

   client beacon:  A beacon sent from a client to a server over the
      signal channel, indicating the client's need for mitigation, and
      the scope of any requested mitigation, optionally including
      detected attack telemetry to supplement server-initiated
      mitigation.

   server beacon:  A message sent from a server to a client over the
      signal channel.  Note that a server beacon is not a response to
      client beacon, but a server-initiated status message sent to the
      client.

   signal relay:  A DOTS-aware network element acting as server and
      client.  A signal relay receives client beacons and relays them to
      another server, and passes server beacons back to the client.

   data channel:  A secure communication layer between client and server
      used for infrequent bulk exchange of data not easily or

      appropriately communicated through the signal channel under attack
      conditions.

2.  Requirements

   This section describes the required features and characteristics of
   the DOTS protocols.  The requirements are aligned with, although not
   directly derived from, the use cases described in [I-D.ietf-dots-use-
   cases].

   DOTS must at a minimum make it possible for a client to request a
   server's aid in mounting a coordinated defense against a detected
   attack, and client should similarly be able to withdraw that request
   arbitrarily.  Regular feedback between client and server supplement
   the defensive alliance by maintaining a common understanding of DOTS
   peer health and activity.  Bidirectional communication between
   endpoints is critical

   Yet the DOTS protocol must also work with a set of competing
   operational goals.  On the one hand, the protocol must be resilient
   under extremely hostile network conditions, providing continued
   contact between endpoints even as attack attack traffic saturates the
   link.  Such resiliency may be developed several ways, but
   characteristics such as small message size, asynchronous, redundant
   message delivery and minimal connection state (when possible given
   local network policy) with a given network will tend to contribute to
   robustness called for in the DOTS charter.

   On the other hand, DOTS must have adequate message confidentiality,
   integrity and authenticity to keep the protocol from becoming another
   vector for the very attacks it's meant to help fight off.  The client
   must be authenticated to the server, and vice versa, for DOTS to
   operate safely, meaning the endpoints must have a way to negotiate
   and agree upon the terms of protocol security.

   The server and client must also have some common method of defining
   the scope of any mitigation performed by the mitigator, as well as
   making adjustments to other commonly configurable features, such as
   listen ports.

   Finally, DOTS should provide sufficient extensibility to meet local,
   vendor or future needs in coordinated attack defense, although this
   consideration is necessarily superseded by the other operational
   requirements.

2.1.  General Requirements

   G-001  Interoperability: DOTS's objective is to develop a standard
      mechanism for signaling detected ongoing DDoS attacks.  That
      objective is unattainable without well-defined specifications for
      any protocols or data models emerging from DOTS.  All protocols,
      data models and interfaces MUST be detailed enough to ensure
      interoperable implementations.

   G-002  Extensibility: Any protocols or data models developed as part
      of DOTS MUST be designed to support future extensions.  Provided
      they do not undermine the interoperability and backward
      compatibility requirements, extensions are a critical part of
      keeping DOTS adaptable to changing operational and proprietary
      needs to keep pace with evolving DDoS attack methods.

   G-003  Resilience: The signaling protocol MUST be designed to
      maximize the probability of signal delivery even under the
      severely constrained network conditions imposed by the attack
      traffic.  The protocol SHOULD be resilient-- that is, continue
      operating despite message loss and out-of-order or redundant
      delivery, and without depending on transport retransmission--as
      opposed to reliable, as the additional round-trips incurred by
      reliable transmission will decrease beacon delivery likelihood
      over congested links.

   G-004  Bidirectionality: To support peer health detection, to
      maintain an open signal channel, and to increase the probability
      of beacon delivery during attack, the signal channel MUST be
      bidirectional, with client and server transmitting beacons to each
      other at regular intervals, regardless of any client request for
      mitigation.

   G-004  Limited Message Size: To avoid message fragmentation and the
      consequent additional packet transmission, signaling protocol
      message size MUST be kept under signaling path Maximum
      Transmission Unit (MTU), including the byte overheader of any
      encapsulation, transport headers, and transport- or message-level
      security.

   G-005  Message Integrity: DOTS protocols MUST take steps to protect
      the confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of messages sent
      between client and server.  While specific transport- and message-
      level security options are not specified, the protocols MUST
      follow current industry best practices for encryption and message
      authentication.

Internet-Draft   DDoS Open Threat Signaling Requirements  September 2015


      In order for DOTS protocols to remain secure despite advancements
      in cryptanalysis, DOTS peers MUST be able to negotiate the terms
      and mechanisms of protocol security, subject to the
      interoperability and signal message size requirements above.

   G-006  Bulk Data Exchange: While the resilience requirement above
      demands a small message size, there are scenarios in which
      infrequent bulk data exchange between a DOTS client and server are
      valuable, for example [Move to use cases? -AM]:

      *  Population of black- or white-listed source addresses on the
         mitigator by the client, or similar configuration or hinting
         that will supplement attack response by the mitigator.

      *  Client discovery of available server signaling endpoints,
         allowing the client to establish signal sessions with multiple
         servers for redundancy.

      *  Address group aliasing, allowing the client and server to refer
         to arbitrarily-sized collections of client-controlled prefixes
         in beacons transmitted between the two.

      *  Pre-shared keys for transport- or message-level security.

      *  Exchange of managed incident or similarly organized reports.
         [Too much overlap with MILE/RID? -AM]

      As the resilience requirements above mandate small signal message
      size, a separate, secure data channel SHOULD be used for bulk data
      exchange.  The mechanism for bulk data exchange is not yet
      specified.

2.2.  Operational requirements

   OP-001  Use of Common Transports: DOTS MUST operate over common
      standardized transport protocols.  While the protocol resilience
      requirement [G-NNN] strongly RECOMMENDS the use of connectionless
      protocols, in particular the User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
      [RFC0768], use of a standardized, connection-oriented protocol
      like the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) [RFC0793] MAY be
      necessary due to network policy or middleware limitations.

   OP-002  Peer Mutual Authentication: The client and server MUST
      authenticate each other before a DOTS session is considered
      active.  The method of authentication is not specified, but should
      follow current industry best practices with respect to any
      cryptographic mechanisms to authenticate the remote peer.

Internet-Draft   DDoS Open Threat Signaling Requirements  September 2015


   OP-003  Session Health Monitoring: The client and server MUST
      regularly send beacons to each other after mutual authentication
      in order to keep the DOTS session open.  A session MUST be
      considered active until a client or server explicity end the
      session, or either endpoint fails to receive beacons from the
      other after a mutually negotiated timeout period has elapsed.

   OP-005  Mitigation Capability Opacity: DOTS is a threat signaling
      protocol.  The server and mitigator MUST NOT make any assumption
      about the attack detection, classfication, or mitigation
      capabilities of the client.  While the server and mitigator MAY
      take hints from any attack telemetry included in client beacons,
      the server and mitigator cannot depend on the client for
      authoritative attack classification.  Similarly, the mitigator
      cannot assume the client can or will mitigate attack traffic on
      its own.

      The client likewise MUST NOT make any assumptions about the
      capabilities of the server or mitigator with respect to detection,
      classification, and mitigation of DDoS attacks.  The form of any
      attack response undertaken by the mitigator is not in scope.

   OP-006  Mitigation Status: DOTS clients MUST be able to request or
      withdraw a request for mitigation from the server.  The server
      MUST honor a client request to withdraw from coordinated attack
      response.

      A server MAY refuse to engage in coordinated attack response with
      a client.  To make the status of a client's request clear, the
      server MUST indicate in server beacons whether client-initiated
      mitigation is active.  When a client-initiated mitigation is
      active, and threat handling details such as mitigation scope and
      statistics are available to the server, the server SHOULD include
      those details in server beacons sent to the client.

   OP-007  Mitigation Scope: DOTS clients MUST also indicate the the
      desired address space coverage of any mitigation, for example by
      using Classless Internet Domain Routing (CIDR) [RFC1518],[RFC1519]
      prefixes, the length/prefix convention established in the Border
      Gateway Protocol (BGP) [RFC4271], or by a prefix group alias
      agreed upon with the server through the data channel.  If
      additional information narrowing the scope of any requested attack
      response, such as targeted port range, protocol, or service,
      clients SHOULD include that information in client beacons.

      As an active attack evolves, clients MUST be able to adjust as
      necessary the scope of requested mitigation by refining the
      address space requiring intervention.
